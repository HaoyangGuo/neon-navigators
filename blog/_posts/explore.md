## Update
Over the past week, I completed the first level, which represents the first layer of the firewall that the player need to breach through. I focused on implementing the technical features that are best suited for navigating through a maze. More specifically, I implemented **teleportation** as the main way of travel which significantly reduded potential motion sickness. I also implemented **dynamic arrow** and a **minimap** to help the player discern directions. I introduced a selection method like **grabbing** and a manipulation method such as **attaching an object to the virtual controller**. These allow the player to interact with the UI and objects. I've also realized that since I am working alone, I should limit the project to six technical features. This ensures that I have enough time to finish developing a playable demo.
