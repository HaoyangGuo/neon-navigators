## Update
Moving from conceptualization to concrete development in Neon Navigator, I've made significant progress. The first challenge was the grid-based floor design, crucial for achieving the Tron-like aesthetic. However, a moire pattern effect at the edges of the viewport made the grid lines appear as dots. After various attempts with a custom shader, I resolved this issue by replacing it with a regular .png texture. Alongside this, I've meticulously planned the puzzles for each level, setting the stage for the next step - implementation.
