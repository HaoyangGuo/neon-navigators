## Update
Over the past week, I completed the second and third levels. In the second level, players use a weapon to defeat both flying and walking enemies. The weapon itself can be grabbed by the player with the virtual controller, and it **shoots projectiles** (manipulation) when the player presses the index trigger button. For the third level, the player needs to use the left controller to rotate the tunnel, allowing them to avoid obstacles. I also implemented the game's ending, where players can use the combination they obtained from beating the levels to unlock a safe that contains valuable data. To unlock this safe, the player needs to use the virtual controller and input the passcode through a **number pad** (symbolic input). Overall, I believe the project is nearing completion. My next step is to thoroughly test the project.
