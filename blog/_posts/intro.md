## Name
Neon Navigators

## Game Concept
In 'Neon Navigators', players become Hiro, a skilled hacker navigating through the cyberspace of the notorious Tanaka Tech Industries. The mission is to breach layers of complex firewalls and retrieve the classified Quantum Code Sequences. Each firewall layer presents unique challenges, from encrypted data mazes to defensive AI programs. Hiro must survive these threats, find fragments of a passcode, and unveil the corporation's role in the Quantum Disruption Event.
  
## Tentative Technical Features:
- Selection: Virtual hand
- Manipulation: Grabbing and placing objects, shooting projectiles
- Wayfinding: Minimap and dynamic arrow
- Travel: Continuous travel with rapid/continuous turns
- Symbolic Input: Elements like passcode numpads, keyboards, hacking minigame

## Inspiration and Style
Neon Navigators draws heavy inspiration from the movie Tron, capturing its sleek, minimalist neon aesthetic. Each challenge in the game is a simplified version of those found in the movie.
